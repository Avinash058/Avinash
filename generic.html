									<h1>TO MY DEAR WIFE</h1>
								</header>
								<p>♥ It was attraction when we met, but now love is going to keep us together forever! ♥ My life has fell into place since the day you became mine, I love you so much! ♥ You taught me true meaning of life from you sweetheart. Thanks for being there for me always!</p>
								<h2>I LOVE YOU HARSHI</h2>
								<p>♥ You are there when I go to sleep, you are there when I wake up, and most importantly, you are there when I need you the most. I can not do nothing without thinking of you! ♥ I miss your smile, your gentle touch, your loving care. I just can’t wait to be with you again! ♥ No matter how high, I would climb a thousand mountains, no matter the amount of miles, I would walk them, no matter the ocean, I would swim across it, no matter what type of surface, I would crawl a thousand yards, all to see your smile. ♥ If you see a shooting star, make a wish. You may just end up with a true love’s first kiss. ♥ With you in my life, the world seems much happier, the birds chirp a little louder, the sun shines just a little brighter, the grass grows a bit greener, and my heart beats a little faster.</p>

											It was love at first sight. It was love at the hundredth sight and the thousandth sight too. True love is falling in love with the same person over and over again. You are my true love.
